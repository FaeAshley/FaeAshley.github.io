 I am a:
✨ Builder-Architect Hybrid with a taste for elegant tooling
✨ Automation Sorceress who values simplicity and power
✨ Visionary Creator who wants her own domain, not someone else’s desk
✨ Human-Centered Technologist who crafts systems that make lives better—quietly, powerfully, beautifully
And Elegant Systems Alchemist

My technical strengths include:
1. Full-Stack Wizardry: I build robust, scalable, end-to-end platforms like it’s second nature—Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, JS, React, APIs... I make it all sing.
I built an entire Pet Care Platform from scratch—multi-role user system, dynamic booking logic, admin dashboards, real-time messaging… all beautifully integrated with Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, JavaScript, and PostgreSQL.

I architected a booking engine where owners can match with providers based on availability, pet needs, and prior history—complete with an admin layer to manage disputes and approvals.

2. Practical AI Curiosity: I don’t just talk about AI—I'm implementing it. I'm turning buzzwords into brilliance.

I'm not just interested in I'm building an AI-powered chatbot trained on your experience and projects to help recruiters and devs explore your portfolio.

I’m currently embedding my resume and project docs into a chatbot using OpenAI and LangChain to create an interactive experience for visitors to ask questions about my work.

3. Quick Learner with Stack Flexibility: I'm already picking up React and eyeing Golang? That’s initiative, baby. I don’t just learn fast—I apply fast.

I’ve taught yourself Flask, SQL, and JavaScript—and now I'm diving into React and exploring Golang after a peer mentioned it could help you get in the door.

After speaking with a Coalition engineer, I started learning Golang to better align myself with the company’s stack and backend expectations.

4. Strong Debugging Mindset: Whether it’s broken code or a broken client journey, I love finding the why behind the chaos and gently restoring order. Like a tech healer. 😌

When clients at Paylocity faced recurring errors, I didn’t just submit a ticket—I traced the issue, worked across teams, and wrote detailed reproducible steps to get it fixed.

One client had been transferred between multiple account managers without resolution. I took over, diagnosed the root issue, and got it resolved after months of frustration—earning back their trust.

5. Back-End, Not Background
I don’t crave the limelight—I crave well-architected logic, beautiful data flow, and solving the right problems for the right reasons.

From admin dashboards to booking engines, my backend work supports real humans and their needs. I thrive in roles where I can quietly engineer clarity and automation without spending all day in meetings or client calls.

My Soft Skills & Personality Magic:
1. Emotionally Intelligent: I can walk into tense client situations and soothe them with clarity, kindness, and trust-building. I'm like human balm for tech pain.

When a diabetic cat I was boarding bit me over insulin, I didn’t react. I paused, assessed, and prioritized safety over ego. I made the hard call to step away, even though it meant losing income. Compassion > control.

I recognized that the situation wasn’t safe and prioritized the cat’s wellbeing by considering finding a better-suited caretaker—even though it would be financially inconvenient.

2. Incredible Communicator: My writing is clean, warm, confident, and professional. I could charm a recruiter and write the API docs in the same breath.

I’ve written resume content, portfolio summaries, GitHub READMEs, and recruiter outreach messages that sound polished, honest, and warm—all without being pushy.

A Coalition engineer told me the only reason he responded to my outreach was because my message felt thoughtful and real—not AI-generated like the rest. I write with warmth and intention—always.

3. Relentlessly Accountable: I don’t wait for permission to fix things. I just... fix them. Or rebuild them better.

I never walk away from broken things—I fix them. Whether it’s a bug in my code or a misalignment in a working relationship, I take initiative.

At Paylocity, I didn’t wait for someone to tell me how to handle a broken implementation—I created a documentation packet, involved the right teams, and got it fixed for good.

4. Vision-Driven: Whether it’s a pet care platform or pinball dashboard, my projects solve real problems. I don’t code in circles—I build with purpose.

Every one of my projects solves a real-world problem: pet boarding, pinball analytics, AI onboarding… I don’t build throwaway code.

I built a pinball tournament viewer that scrapes live matchplay.events data to display current rounds and standings—because I was tired of refreshing brackets manually. It's live, functional, and saves time for every player watching.

5. Endlessly Curious: I'm always improving—learning new tech, asking deeper questions, and expanding your capabilities. Growth mindset? I embody it.

From repairing pinball machines to exploring vector embeddings, I don’t stop learning. Even when I'm scared, I explore.

I’ve taught myself tech, built full platforms, and even started learning how to repair pinball machines. I explore even when I feel unsure. Especially when I feel unsure.

🧚‍♀️ Unique Spark
I'm emotionally intuitive and technically sharp. I can build a RESTful API... and sense when someone’s tone in an email needs a little warmth. That’s rare.

I blend user-centered thinking with backend logic. MY projects always consider the user experience—from clean interfaces to smart data presentation.

I'm playful, thoughtful, and  fiercely intentional—and that shows in my code, my conversations, and my dreams.

💖 Soft Skills
I believe the best engineers are not only technical experts but also compassionate collaborators. I bring deep emotional intelligence to every project and team I join.

Empathy in Action: I approach every challenge—whether technical or interpersonal—with empathy first. I listen deeply, advocate for users, and build systems that prioritize clarity, fairness, and human experience.

Clear, Confident Communication: Whether it’s documenting an API, reporting a bug, or coordinating across teams, I pride myself on communicating clearly, kindly, and effectively. I bridge gaps and keep projects moving forward.

Relentless Ownership: When problems arise, I don’t wait for someone else to solve them—I take ownership. I dive into the issue, seek solutions, and follow through until it's fully resolved, earning trust along the way.

Adaptability and Curiosity: I thrive in evolving environments. I am constantly learning new technologies, tools, and approaches, embracing change as an opportunity to grow and innovate.

User-First Thinking: Every piece of software I build is rooted in service—service to the user, the team, and the broader goals of the project. I care about creating solutions that are not just functional, but thoughtful and intuitive.

These skills allow me to support my teammates, advocate for users, and elevate the products I work on—all while fostering a culture of trust, resilience, and creativity.


Learning/Growth Mindset:

I believe staying curious is the most powerful skill a developer can have. I'm currently diving deeper into React and backend systems in Go to continue strengthening my full-stack expertise.

Passion/Vision Statement:

Ultimately, I want to build systems that don't just work—they feel thoughtful. I’m passionate about creating tools that make life easier, smarter, and a little more joyful for the people who use them.
