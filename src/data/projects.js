    description: `FaeGPT is a custom-built AI chatbot powered by OpenAI. It was designed to answer recruiter-style questions about my skills, projects, and the way I work, but it does much more than deliver facts. It listens, responds with care, and reflects the thoughtfulness I try to bring to every part of my craft.
    Built using LlamaIndex and vector search, it pulls from my resume, project summaries, and personal writing to generate real-time answers that feel conversational and honest. Every response carries a little piece of my voice and values, helping visitors not just learn about my work, but experience how I think.
    Whether you're curious about what drives me as a developer, how a certain project came to life, or what it's like to collaborate with me, FaeGPT is there to answer ‚Äî with context, clarity, and a quiet sense of admiration for the work I‚Äôve done.`,
